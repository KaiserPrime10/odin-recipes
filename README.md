Hello odin folk! This is the first website I have made using the knowledge I have gained from the odin project. I liked the process very much and I look forward to develop my skills further in this journey.


This website, "odin Recipes" is an assingnment given by the course.
The Homepage contains Three links, which take you to the recipes of some of my favourite foods. The recipe pages each have a home button through which we can return to the homepage.

Thanks for reading!
