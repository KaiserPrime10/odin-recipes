    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Aloo Parantha is an Indian flatbread made with whole wheat flour, which is stuffed with a filling of boiled spiced potatoes,
        sliced onions and herbs. These flavourful and delicious Paranthas are a staple in many North Indian homes, Dhabas and restaurants.
        These are commonly topped with Ghee (White Butter), Pickle or Yogurt.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>Coriander leaves</li>
        <li>Salt as required</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of mustard oil/any oil of your choice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon onion</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>1 cup wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps of Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Prepare the filling:</p>
        <p>Boil the potatoes at least a few hours before you plan to make the paranthas, mash them in a large bowl, cover up and refrigerate.
            Take them out from the fridge and add chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder and red chilli powder. Mix well so that no lumps remain.
            Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions of the filling will fall out.</p></li>
        <li><p>Prepare the parantha:</p>
            <p>Put the wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make medium balls of the dougth and roll them into a circle
                (make sure to checkout its thickness, a <em>thicc</em> parantha wont be too delicous! It should just be able to hold the filling without breaking.) Fill the parantha with
                the filling and give it a final roll.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>Pan fry the filled parantha</p>
        <p>Heat an iron tawa and put the parantha on it, spread its both  sides with the oil of your choice after they are slightly cooked, so that it doesnt stick to your pan. Roast at low to medium
            flame for  2-3 minutes, or till your parantha is crispy and golden brown.</p></li>
            
        <li>Serve the hot Aloo Parnatha with a side of pickle/curd or a chutney of your choice.</li>
