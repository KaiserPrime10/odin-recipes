        <li>Crush some pieces of ginger and some 6-7 garlic cloves to a fien paste.</li>
        <li>Put 200 grams hung curd (greek yogurt) in a bowl. With a whisk beat the curd lightly till smooth.</li>
        <li>Now add 1 tablespoons ginger garlic paste or 1 tablespoon crushed ginger garlic to the curd. Also add the spice powders and some salt to taste.</li>
